Key Metrics & Insights
1️⃣ Overall GHG Factors
GHG Factors Without Margin: 363.60

This represents the raw emissions data before any adjustments or margins are applied.

GHG Factors With Margin: 392.19

This includes adjustments and additional considerations, giving a more accurate reflection of emissions.

GHG Factor Difference: 28.62

The margin-adjusted emissions show an increase of 28.62 over the base value.

2️⃣ GHG Factor Differences by Industry (2017 NAICS Title)
This section compares emissions across different industries, highlighting which sectors contribute the most.

Industries with the highest GHG factor differences:

Anthracite & Bituminous Coal

Cement Manufacturing

Beef Cattle Ranching

Cattle Feedlots

Solid Waste Management

3️⃣ Sector-Specific GHG Factors
GHG Factors Without Margin by Industry

Solid Waste Management has the highest emissions in this category.

Cement, beef cattle ranching, and cattle feedlots also contribute significantly.

GHG Factors With Margin by Industry

Solid Waste Management remains the highest at 11.0

Cement manufacturing, beef cattle ranching, and cattle feedlots contribute around 3.3 - 3.9 units.

4️⃣ GHG Factor Difference Analysis
The circular graph highlights the total GHG difference of 28.62, showing how much emissions increase when margin factors are applied.

The range varies between 0.00 and 57.25, indicating variability across industries.

5️⃣ Goal Tracking & Final Insights
The GHG Factor with Margin vs. Without Margin is set against a goal of 0.16, which is currently achieved (✔).

This shows improvements in emission tracking and possible reductions, but the difference of 28.62 suggests room for further mitigation strategies.

📍 Conclusion & Key Takeaways
✅ Solid Waste Management is the highest GHG-emitting sector both before and after margin adjustments.
✅ GHG emissions increase by 28.62 after margin adjustments, indicating additional environmental impacts.
✅ Beef cattle, cement manufacturing, and coal industries are among the largest contributors.
✅ Tracking goals show improvement, but more efforts are needed to minimize emissions further.

🚀 Actionable Recommendations
🔹 Implement emission reduction policies in high-impact sectors (waste management, cement, and livestock).
🔹 Increase renewable energy and waste management initiatives to offset emissions.
🔹 Refine data margins and calculations to provide more precise emission estimates.
